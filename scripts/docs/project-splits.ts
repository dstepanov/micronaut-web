 * read, link, and are searched exactly like the separate projects they are
 * about to become.
 *
 * Nothing upstream changes: the derived project shares the source project's
 * repository, branch, module coordinates and version, and only the guide's
 * top-level table-of-contents sections are divided between the two pages.
