## Open Discussion

- Java Baseline Discussion:

  - Jen shared the results of the Twitter poll and email campaign
  - Micronaut framework 4.0.0 should support a minimum Java version of:

    - 68% of the community responded in support of Java 17
    - 25% of the community responded in support of Java 11
    - 7% of the community responded in support of Java 8
  - James: Do we know when the cloud vendors will be updated to support Java 17?
  - Guillaume: I think what you described is a pragmatic approach and a good one
  - Graeme: I think even if the cloud vendors aren’t ready, people will still be able to use Micronaut 3 for some time
  - James: Is there a solid plan in place for the Micronaut 3 support after the move to Java 17?
  - James: I think that is an important message to the community in terms of what they can expect in terms of Micronaut 3 support
  - Sergio: Back-porting features to Micronaut 3 may be an important thing to do
- KSP Support

  - James – I’m hoping to get KSP support available by Micronaut 4 and I would love for it to be the default in Micronaut 4.  They have been receptive in terms of PRs
- Project Loom

  - Graeme – It would be nice to be able to configure the Micronaut executors to use a virtual thread pool.  Additionally we need to explore the Netty event loop using a virtual thread pool.  The benefit would be that even if you do i/o operations it wouldn’t block
  - James – Regarding loom, this is an article I read recently about thread fairness in CPU-bound workloads.  I think there still needs to be an option to not use Loom
  - Graeme – Loom is still a bit away in Java 19
  - James – Does Netty have a plan for Loom?  I think Netty 5 is coming out soon
  - Graeme – We’re keeping an eye on Netty 5, but it seems to be a long way off.  I don’t think it’ll make it for Micronaut 4
  - Graeme – I don’t think that Loom completely solves the need for reactive and I think we’ll be doing reactive side-by-side for some time
